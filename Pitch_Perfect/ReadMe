Description of App:- An iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback.

Things I learnt from making this App using the Udacity 'Intro to iOS App Development with Swift' course, are:-
Thanks to this course assisting me to create this app, I have learnt the introduction of iOS and Xcode basic and fundamental knowledge and skills. This includes:-
1. How to install Xcode
2. The various settings, views and options within Xcode and how to use them. 
3. The concept of MVC - Model, View and Controller
4.  How to add view objects such as buttons and labels, and how to connect view objects with their relevant view controller, via IBActions and Outlets.
5. How to add constraints for view objects on a StoryBoard. 
6. The ViewController life cycle - e.g. Viewdidload, viewWilllAppear ...etc.
7. How to compile and launch an App using various configurations and devices on a simulator. 
8. How to add various media files - e.g. images and audio files.
9. How to add images to buttons.
10. UINavigationController and how it manages various ViewControllers within it, with Navigation bar and optional tab bar.
11. Adding scenes in storyboard with their default ViewControllers via Segues that connect them together. 
12. Playing a pre-recorded audio file, with slow and fast effect.
13. Recording an audio file to be stored in a directory path.
14. Concept of Delegates and utilising Apple written functions in a Protocol. 
15. Model concept and creating custom class to store audio file details such as URL and Title of file in the custom class (The Model).
16. Understanding of Segues - identifying them and passing files through them to the next/destination ViewController.  
17. Playing recorded audio using chipmunk and Darth Vader effect, using the concept of AVAudioEngine and its various nodes (input, processing and output nodes). 
18. Downloading App on your phone.
